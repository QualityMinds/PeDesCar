# pedestrian_impact 

This intends to generate datasets related to impact collision using Mujoco Physics Engine, OpenAI, RL for human motion prediction.

## How To Start

The impact collision environment is tested on mujoco 3.0.0. Run the impact_collision.xml to initialize the simulation.
Choose the car model prius or autocar by comment or uncommet line 2 or 3 in the .xml.
The folder assets contains all the individual xml of humanoids and cars models.
The meshes under assets contains the shape of the 3D objects used to construct the humanoids or cars.
The textures contains the coloring of the models.
